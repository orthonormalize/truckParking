Virginia Rest Area Truck Parking Information

This app provides information regarding truck parking at Virginia rest areas. Many trucks have limited maneuverability for navigating rest area parking lots, so it is critical that drivers do not pass the last available spot in search of a better one. If they do, they could end up either parking illegally along the shoulder or exceeding their allowable driving hours. Both situations decrease public safety, and the former can shorten the pavement lifecycle. A trucker who has access to real-time parking occupancy info before driving through the rest area will be able to make better decisions.
